Kernel repository that can be used to compile Armbian and OpenWer firmware.

## Description

- The kernel files stored in the [pub/stable](pub/stable) directory is a stable version produced and shared by [flippy](https://github.com/unifreq), suitable for use in a formal production environment.
- The kernel files stored in the [pub/dev](pub/dev) directory is a development version, and third-party driver support and special modifications have been added for some specific devices, for development and testing use.
- The kernel files stored in the [pub/eol](pub/eol) directory are the kernel series that have stopped updating and are used for nostalgia.

The kernel files can be used in projects such as [amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt), [amlogic-s9xxx-armbian](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian), [flippy-openwrt-actions](https://github.com/ophub/flippy-openwrt-actions) and [unifreq/openwrt_packit](https://github.com/unifreq/openwrt_packit), etc. How to use it can be found in the description of each item.
